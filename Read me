Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP)


Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP) is a simple, lock-step, File Transfer Protocol which allows a client to get from or put a file onto a remote host. One of its primary uses is in the early stages of nodes booting from a local area network. TFTP has been used for this application because it is very simple to implement.

All the files are stored in the current directory “PROJ".
 

REQUIREMENT:
	*	You should have TFTP server installed on the system.
	*	Once the TFTP server is installed, download the zip, extract the files in the folder.
	*	Compile the java files.
	*	Run the Client class.


COMPILATION & EXECUTION STEPS:
 
1. Open a terminal.
2. Browse to this directory.
4. Compile all files.                                                                       command: javac *.java
5. Run the tftp client program.                                                   command: java Client
 
COMMANDS IMPLEMENTED:
	*	“connect” command
	*	“get” command
	*	“quit” command
	*	“?” command (for help)
	*	I have not implemented “put” command because our college (RIT) does not allow us to put files on the server.
 
FILES:
README.txt: Information about file structure, compilation, execution.
Client.java - TFTP client implementation.
Packet.java - Base class for all types of TFTP packets and defines the TFTP Error, Ack packet type.
